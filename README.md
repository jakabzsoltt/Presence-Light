Update! <BR>
A case for the slim version has been aded. <BR>
The case itself is my design however the mounting parts can be used from Everything Presence ONE available on printables
https://www.printables.com/model/302846-everything-presence-one-official-case/files <BR>
I also added a modified mount without screws for a smaller footprint (use double sided tape to mount). <BR>
So you will to print: <BR>
1.Upper case (which is actually the back) I suggest PETG because of snap fittings, PLA will easyly break. <BR>
2.Lower case ( you can use a heat insert and screw to fix the board in one corner) <BR>
3.Everything Presence One Lock Nut <BR>
4.Everything Presence One Ball Joint <BR>
5.A stand of your choice <BR>
I printed in PETG and I had to scale the stands to 103% in the slicer because in my case the balljoint was loose.
