Update!
A case for the slim version has been aded.
The case itself is my design however the mounting parts can be used from Everything Presence ONE available on printables
https://www.printables.com/model/302846-everything-presence-one-official-case/files
I also added a modified mount without screws for a smaller footprint (use double sided tape to mount).
So you will to print:
1.Upper case (which is actually the back)
2.Lower case ( you can use a heat inser and screw to fix the board in one corner)
3.Everything Presence One Lock Nut
4.Everything Presence One Ball Joint
5.A stand of your choice
I printed in PETG and I had to scale the stands to 103% in the slicer because in my case the balljoint was loose.


A small PCB to build your own Radar and Light sensor with ESP32 D1 mini. Soldering is required!
